## Cat & Dog problem.
## Real case study
You are a new CIO of a national bank. You have to decide wether a server that has not been touched for 10 years should be shut down.
## Decisions
How we want it to be: Pros & Cons Option A / Pros & Cons Option B.
How it is: How will *I feel* after choosing option A/ How will *I feel* after choosing option B.
## Some facts about emotions
- you can't choose nor control your emotions
- emotions feed you rational brain
- rational brain optimises for emotional experience
- emotions can and will shut down your rational brain
"When you're stressed, you can't think rationally."
## Stories we tell ourselves determine how we think we will feel.
- I don't want to be questioned -> It is better to wait
- I take difficult decisions -> I will shut down the server
- I am street smart -> I will ask interns to make savings
Personal example:
- I do not feel like working out today ->
    - force yourself to go though hardship
    - think how you will feel after the workout
    - think how you will feel if you do not do the workout

If you want to know what people actually think give them 3 positive/negative things. (shape of a triangle graph and place a dot in the area)
